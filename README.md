# Smart Dining: A Machine Learning Approach to Caloric Display in Bangladeshi Restaurants

This repository implements a **machine learning-based caloric estimation system** for traditional Bangladeshi dishes. By integrating machine learning models with menu systems, this project aims to promote nutritional awareness and healthier eating habits.

---

## üìÑ Project Overview

### Motivation
With diet-related health issues prevalent in Bangladesh, this system provides real-time caloric information for traditional dishes, empowering users to make informed dietary choices.

### Objectives
1. Compile and preprocess a dataset of Bangladeshi recipes and ingredients.
2. Train and evaluate models, including:
   - Linear Regression
   - Decision Tree Regressor
   - Random Forest Regressor
3. Deploy the best-performing model for real-time caloric prediction.

## üìä Dataset

### Sources
- **Food Composition Table for Bangladesh (2022)**: Nutritional information.
- **Traditional Cookbooks**: Recipes and caloric breakdowns.

### Data Preprocessing
- Extracted features: Ingredient quantities.
- Target variable: Total caloric content.

### Example Data Format:
| Recipe Name  | Ingredient_1 | Ingredient_2 | Total Calories |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|----------------|
| Chicken Curry| 100g         | 50g          | 450 kcal       |
